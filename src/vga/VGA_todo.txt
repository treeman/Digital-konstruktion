#TODO
1.  Check VGA-timing numbers on monitor manial.
2.  Calculate first the screen refresh(SF) rate by using field refresh rate(FR): SF = 1/FR
3.  Get Line refresh rate, then multiply the total lines to get Vertical display time. Use 
    vertical timing minus vertical display time to get vertical sync delay time.
4.  Check how long does it needed for a single instruction being executed by microcontroller.
5.  Then calculate how many distinct spot across each line as data output is possible per line. 
    (or this can be fixed by adding a input delay for each pixel like what we did in vga-block)
6.  we need to have 5 outputs to the VGA connector. 
7.  The perfect clock input for 640*480 resolution is 25,175
8.
